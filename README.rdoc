To setup the server you need to first clone the repo in your local server.

Run `bundle install` from the command prompt.

Now go to `config/database.yml` file and configure the database which you want to use along with entering the username and password.

Now run
`rake db:migrate`

This will create all the tables for you.

All you have to do now is to start the rails server. You can do that by typing the following command.

`rails s`
